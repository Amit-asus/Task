🔁 Flow Description

1. Dialog Trigger and Input
	•	The dialog opens when isOpen is true.
	•	User types a new make name into the input field (newMakeInput).

2. On Confirm: Main Logic Flow

When the user clicks “Confirm & Associate”, the following steps are executed:

Step 1: Validate Input
	•	Ensure input is not empty.
	•	Ensure categoryName is available.

Step 2: Check If Make Exists
	•	Look for a make with the same name (case-insensitive) in makeList.

Step 3: If Make Exists
	•	Check if it’s already in associatedMakes.
	•	✅ Yes → Show “Already Associated” toast and stop.
	•	❌ No → Proceed to associate with the category.

Step 4: If Make Doesn’t Exist
	•	Create a new make document using createDoc("Makelist", ...).

Step 5: Check If Association Already Exists
	•	Use categoryMakelist to check if the make-category combination already exists.

Step 6: If Association is New
	•	Create a new association using createDoc("Category Makelist", ...).

Step 7: Notify Parent
	•	Prepare a MakeOption object: { value, label }.
	•	Call onMakesAssociated([newMakeOption]).

Step 8: Refresh Data
	•	Call makeListMutate() if a new make was created.
	•	Call categoryMakeListMutate() if a new association was made.

Step 9: Feedback to User
	•	Show success or error toast based on outcome.
